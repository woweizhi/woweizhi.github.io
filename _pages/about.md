My name is Xiangyu Guo, a first-year Ph.D. student in BioEngineering (Bioinformatics and Machine Learning Track) at [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en), supervised by [Prof. Ricardo Henao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p_mm4-YAAAAJ&hl=en). My current research mainly focuses at the intersection of biomedical data and AI, disease diagnosis and monitoring, Spatial transcriptomics and moti-modal data integration. For additional details regarding my academic and professional experiences, please refer to my [CV](../files/CV-KAUST.pdf).
